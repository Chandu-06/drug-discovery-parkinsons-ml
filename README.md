-> Drug Discovery using GraphDTA for Parkinson’s Disease
This project focuses on predicting drug–target binding affinity using GraphDTA, a graph neural network-based model. The goal is to identify potential small molecules that can effectively bind to Parkinson’s-related protein targets — aiding the early stages of drug discovery.

-> Overview
Drugs are represented as molecular graphs using SMILES strings.

Proteins are represented as amino acid sequences.

Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug representation.

Predicts binding affinity using a regression model trained on benchmark datasets.
